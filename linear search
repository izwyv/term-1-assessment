1. How does the time complexity vary for linear search based on the input size?
2. LinearSearch(array, target):
    for each element in the array:
        if element equals target:
            return index of the element
    return "Not found"

    The pseudocode is of a linear sarch algorithm is provided above. Modify the linear search algorithm to return all occurences of the target element
